# Project Title

Personal Portfolio

# Project Approach

This project will consist of a personal Portfolio, build from the ground up using the MERN STACK
.

## Backend and database

In the backend, I will create a REST API from scratch connected to MongoDB.
then incorporate the use of the ODM Mongoose.
I will create a JWT-protected Auth system and have the AccessToken to allow access and RefreshToken to retrieve sessions. The backend will be executed in Express JS and NODE.jS

## Frontend

For the client side of this portfolio, I will be using React and SASS. I will create a dynamic React Router Dom configuration as well as a Layout System. created an Administrator panel so that our users with privileges can manage the web. Add a blog system with pagination, that's managed from the admin panel.

## API Section

I will create a course upload section connected to the Udemy Affiliate API.

## SEO

A website without SEO is not a website, so I will be implementing basic SEO to the portfolio

## Deployment

The project will be deployed to the cloud usig MongoDB Atlas For the Database, Heroku for NODE.jS and Express Backend and Netlify for the Front End
